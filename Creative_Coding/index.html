      Hi! I'm Barry.

      Welcome to my website! This is where I'll be putting all of my coding assignments this semester.

      Below is a photo of me that I took in Spring of 2023. I don't really look like this anymore, but I still really like the photo and use it for everything. I wouldn't consider myself a model, but sometimes I think I can be an influencer.
